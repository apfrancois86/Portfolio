              <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Alex Francois</strong> and I was born and raised in <em>Oakland, California</em>. In 2005 I moved up to <em>Eugene, Oregon</em> to attend school at the <em>University of Oregon</em>. In 2009 I graduated with a degree in Accounting and moved back home. I worked in the Accounting industry for 6 years. Although I learned a lot and meet some great people during this time I decided that accounting was not what I wanted long-term for my career. I wanted to have a career that was creative, forward thinking, and had more of a focus on problem-solving, logic, and technology. After about a year of soul searching, talking to people in different industries, and doing extensive reasearh I decided a career in software engineering was right for me. Now I am currently attending <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> to build my skillset and start my career in software engineering. I  am extremely excited about this opportunity to re-invent myself!</p>
