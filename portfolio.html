              <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Alex Francois</strong> and I was born and raised in <em>Oakland, California</em>. In 2005 I moved up to <em>Eugene, Oregon</em> to attend school at the <em>University of Oregon</em>. In 2009 I graduated with a degree in accounting and moved back home. I worked in the accounting industry for 6 years. Although I learned a lot and meet some great people during this time I decided that accounting was not what I wanted to do long-term for my career. I want to have a career that is creative, forward thinking, and have more of a focus on problem-solving, logic, and technology. After about a year of soul searching, talking to people in different industries, and doing extensive online reasearh I decided a career in software engineering was right for me. Now I am currently attending <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> to build my skill-set and start my career in software engineering. I  am extremely excited about this opportunity to re-invent myself!</p>

              <h5>October 14, 2016</h5>
              <p>Today is the first independent assignment for my Intro class. It is really quiet in here and everyone is working really hard. I like my project and hope it meets all the requirements. It will be nice to have a little time off this weekend but I also can't wait to see what next week brings.</p>
